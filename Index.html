<P>My parents recently moved from Palm Bay to Sarasota, Florida -- from one coast of the state to another. <A HREF="Map.html"> click here to see map</a> I have been to Palm Bay many times, and I have to say, I don’t like it very much. It always gave me the impression that I am out of place. It has beaches and different attraction sites that would make it appealing to different age groups, but it simply didn’t do it for me. My parents are expecting me to spend the summer with them this year and I am quite excited because I get to experience a completely different scenery, besides, there is no way that Sarasota can be as bad as Palm bay; let’s just say I’ve done my research.
</P>
<P>With the move from retiree’s town to the home of the Ringling Brothers Circus (nothing against the elderly), it sounds like a blast of a summer vacation is in order, right? Not so much. See, I am at place where I have to start making better decisions especially when it comes to my college education/career. Allow me to elaborate. I am a second year at the University of Georgia and I am in the process of applying to Terry as a finance major. I know one of the requirements for graduation is to obtain an internship where one can acquire basic business skills. So I made it my mission to attain a position at a bank or a financial institution this summer because I don’t believe there is such a thing as enough experience. 
</P>

<P>As mentioned earlier, this is my first time going to Sarasota, Florida. Therefore, I have not the slightest idea what opportunities await me down there. Since I am an opportunist, I like to think that it’s a goldmine, but only time will tell.
